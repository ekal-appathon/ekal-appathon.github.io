		<h1>Who we are</h1>
		<div class="one-half">
			<p>Ekal Vidyalaya is a grassroots movement involved in taking education to the child instead of the other way round. The main activity undertaken in this movement is to run one-teacher schools, in the remotest rural & tribal villages, at the bare minimum cost of a dollar a day. Ideas generated in order to execute such a mission include a mobile vehicle equipped with low cost computers making day visits to the remote sites, thereby providing access to information.</p>
			<p>This app-a-thon has been conceptualized by close associates of Ekal Vidyalaya, who have incidentally been part of the team of inventors behind MIT's App Inventor. The perceived shortcomings in App Inventor have motivated them to launch their own company Thunkable, a drag-and-drop tool for anyone to build native mobile apps - for both Android and IOS (this is work-in-progress).</p>
			<p>Suffice it to say that Ekal Vidyalaya and Thunkable are working together to organize this event to encourage the ideators around you and the dreamer within you.</p>
